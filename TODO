TODO

- add option to show only DLCs for games the users already has

- revise the filter interface, not just checkboxes
  This should allow for more options, sliders etc

- improve the animation when loading new elements with endless
  scrolling; we don't need animate elements outside of view 

- Add timeout to endless scrolling; click on 'gremlins' bar to
  try again

- Improve contributor filter with the ability to select a range

- Make the filter interface more user friendly

- Add functionality to tag users with banners, just like
  in Reddit Enhacement Suit, tags viewable across steamgifts.com

- add mechanism to detect configuration errors;
  provide users with information how to fix them

- recode the addon with a modular approach in mind

- add botton to reset preferences to default

- display stats about size of localStorage;
  suggest increasing space when 70-80% full
