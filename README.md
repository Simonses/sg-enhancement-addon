For *Internet Explorer* create following bookmark:
<pre>
javascript:(function(){var script = document.createElement("script"); script.type = "text/javascript";script.src = "https://raw.github.com/rossengeorgiev/sg-enhancement-addon/master/sg_enhancement_addon_base.js"; document.body.appendChild(script);})()
</pre>

You will need to activate the bookmark on the main page each time you loaded. It tedious and I will strongly advise you to consider using one of the better browsers available.
